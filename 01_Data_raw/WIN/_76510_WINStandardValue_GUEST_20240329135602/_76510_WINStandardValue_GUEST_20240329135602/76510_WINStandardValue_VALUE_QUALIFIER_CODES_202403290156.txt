"1"|"A"|"Value reported is the arithmetic mean (average) of two or more determinations. This code shall be used if the reported value is the average of results for two or more discrete and separate samples. These samples shall have been processed and analyzed independently. Do not use this code if the data are the result of replicate analysis on the same sample aliquot, extract or digestate."|"01-JAN-2014 00:00:00"|""|""|""
"2"|"B"|"Results based upon colony counts outside the acceptable range. This code applies to microbiological tests and specifically to membrane filter colony counts. The code is to be used if the colony count is generated from a plate in which the total number of coliform colonies is outside the method indicated ideal range. This code is not to be used if a 100 mL sample has been filtered and the colony count is less than the lower value of the ideal range."|"01-JAN-2014 00:00:00"|""|""|""
"3"|"F"|"When reporting species: F indicates the female sex."|"01-JAN-2014 00:00:00"|""|""|""
"4"|"H"|"Value based on field kit determination; results may not be accurate. This code shall be used if a field screening test (i.e., field gas chromatograph data, immunoassay, vendor-supplied field kit, etc.) was used to generate the value and the field kit or method has not been recognized by the Department as equivalent to laboratory methods."|"01-JAN-2014 00:00:00"|""|""|""
"5"|"I"|"The reported value is greater than or equal to the laboratory method detection limit but less than the laboratory practical quantitation limit."|"01-JAN-2014 00:00:00"|""|""|""
"6"|"J"|"Estimated value. A 'J' value shall be accompanied by a detailed explanation to justify the reason(s) for designating the value as estimated. Where possible, the organization shall report whether the actual value is estimated to be less than or greater than the reported value. A “J” value shall not be used as a substitute for K, L, M, T, V, or Y, however, if additional reasons exist for identifying the value as an estimate (e.g., matrix spiked failed to meet acceptance criteria), the “J” code may be added to a K, L, M, T, V, or Y. Examples of situations in which a “J” code must be reported include: instances where a quality control item associated with the reported value failed to meet the established quality control criteria (the specific failure must be identified); instances when the sample matrix interfered with the ability to make any accurate determination; instances when data are questionable because of improper laboratory or field protocols (e.g., composite sample was collected instead of a grab sample); instances when the analyte was detected at or above the method detection limit in a blank other than the method blank (such as calibration blank or field-generated blanks and the value of 10 times the blank value was equal to or greater than the associated sample value); or instances when the field or laboratory calibrations or calibration verifications did not meet calibration acceptance criteria."|"01-JAN-2014 00:00:00"|""|""|""
"7"|"K"|"Off-scale low. Actual value is known to be less than the value given. This code shall be used if:  1. The value is less than the lowest calibration standard and the calibration curve is known to be non-linear; or  2. The value is known to be less than the reported value based on sample size, dilution.  This code shall not be used to report values that are less than the laboratory practical quantitation limit or laboratory method detection limit."|"01-JAN-2014 00:00:00"|""|""|""
"8"|"L"|"Off-scale high. Actual value is known to be greater than value given. To be used when the concentration of the analyte is above the acceptable level for quantitation (exceeds the linear range or highest calibration standard) and the calibration curve is known to exhibit a negative deflection."|"01-JAN-2014 00:00:00"|""|""|""
"9"|"M"|"When reporting chemical analyses: presence of material is verified but not quantified; the actual value is less than the value given. The reported value shall be the laboratory practical quantitation limit. This code shall be used if the level is too low to permit accurate quantification, but the estimated concentration is greater than or equal to the method detection limit. If the value is less than the method detection limit use “T” below."|"01-JAN-2014 00:00:00"|""|""|""
"10"|"N"|"Presumptive evidence of presence of material. This qualifier shall be used if:  1. The component has been tentatively identified based on mass spectral library search; or  2. There is an indication that the analyte is present, but quality control requirements for confirmation were not met (i.e., presence of analyte was not confirmed by alternative procedures)."|"01-JAN-2014 00:00:00"|""|""|""

"14"|"U"|"Indicates that the compound was analyzed for but not detected. This symbol shall be used to indicate that the specified component was not detected. The value associated with the qualifier shall be the laboratory method detection limit. Unless requested by the client, less than the method detection limit values shall not be reported (see “T” above)."|"01-JAN-2014 00:00:00"|""|""|""
"15"|"V"|"A “V” qualified sample value indicates that the analyte was detected at or above the method detection limit in both the sample and the associated method blank and the blank value was greater than 10% of the associated sample value. The 10% criterion shall not apply to blank results for biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) or microbiological tests. For BOD tests, the “V” code shall be used for all sample results where the associated method blank result exceeds the maximum blank DO depletion specified in the analytical method. For microbiological tests, the “V” code shall be used for all samples where the associated method blank indicates growth of the target organism. Note: unless specified by the method, the value in the blank shall not be subtracted from associated samples."|"01-JAN-2014 00:00:00"|""|"ADAMS_TL"|"27-OCT-2021 15:30:54"

"17"|"Z"|"Too many colonies were present for accurate counting. Historically, this condition has been reported as “too numerous to count” (TNTC). The “Z” qualifier code shall be reported when the total number of colonies of all types is more than 200 in all dilutions of the sample. When applicable to the observed test results, a numeric value for the colony count for the microorganism tested shall be estimated from the highest dilution factor (smallest sample volume) used for the test and reported with the qualifier code."|"01-JAN-2014 00:00:00"|""|""|""
"18"|"?"|"Data are rejected and should not be used. Some or all of the quality control data for the analyte were outside criteria, and the presence or absence of the analyte cannot be determined from the data."|"01-JAN-2014 00:00:00"|""|""|""

This code applies to any value (except field measurements of pH, specific conductance, dissolved oxygen, temperature, total residual chlorine, transparency, turbidity or salinity) that was obtained under field conditions using approved analytical methods.
