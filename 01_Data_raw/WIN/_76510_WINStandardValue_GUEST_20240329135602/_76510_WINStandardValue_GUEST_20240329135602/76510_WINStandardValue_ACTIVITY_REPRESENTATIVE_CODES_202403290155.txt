"1"|"Not Representative"|"Site conditions on the sampling day and time did not reflect typical conditions for this site.  Atypical conditions include extreme low or high water levels/flows caused by climatological or hydrological factors, or an accidental release of a pollutant.  Sample results may reflect those factors or events rather than the typical site condition.  Sampling may have been conducted to characterize effects of the circumstance or event."|"01-JAN-2014 00:00:00"|""|""|""
"2"|"Representative"|"Site conditions on the sampling day and time reflected typical conditions for this site.  Water level or flow was approximately between the 5th and 95th percentile of historical levels or flows for that site.  This site represents the conditions for the majority of the waterbody segment within which it is located.  These sample results will reflect the true condition at this site."|"01-JAN-2014 00:00:00"|""|""|""
