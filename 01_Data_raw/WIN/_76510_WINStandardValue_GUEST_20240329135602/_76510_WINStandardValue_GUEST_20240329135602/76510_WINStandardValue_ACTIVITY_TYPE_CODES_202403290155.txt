"1"|"Field"|"Analysis of an analyte at the monitoring location.  Analysis is either measured using field equipment or through qualitative observation."|"Field Msr/Obs"|"01-JAN-2014 00:00:00"|""|""|""|"30"
"2"|"Equipment Blank"|"Quality control blank prepared on-site during sampling by pouring analyte-free water through decontaminated field equipment into appropriate sample containers for each matrix and analyte group of interest. Equipment blanks are chemically preserved, stored, transported and analyzed with the collected field samples."|"Quality Control Field Sample Equipment Rinsate Blank"|"01-JAN-2014 00:00:00"|""|""|""|"40"
"3"|"Field Blank"|"Quality control blank prepared on-site during sampling for each analyte group of interest and chemically preserved, stored, transported and analyzed with the collected field samples.  For organizations submitting data for the purposes of FDEP regulatory use, field blanks should be collected by pouring analyte-free water into appropriate sample containers."|"Quality Control Sample-Field Blank"|"01-JAN-2014 00:00:00"|""|""|""|"40"
"4"|"Field Replicate"|"A replicate sample taken within each combination of time, location, and any other controlled variables.  The analytical results from replicates are used to determine the precision of a system.  A replicate may be a duplicate, triplicate, or other multiple."|"Quality Control Sample-Field Replicate"|"01-JAN-2014 00:00:00"|""|""|""|"30"
"5"|"Trip Blank"|"A trip blank is a test sample of analyte-free media taken from the laboratory to the sampling site and returned to the laboratory unopened. They are used to measure cross-contamination from the container and preservative during transport, field handling, and storage. Usually, at least one trip blank should be prepared for each sample type per trip.  For organizations submitting data for the purposes of FDEP regulatory use, one trip blank should be collected per cooler and per trip for VOC samples only."|"Quality Control Sample-Trip Blank"|"01-JAN-2014 00:00:00"|""|""|""|"40"
"6"|"Sample"|"A representative portion of a sample matrix (e.g., water, air, sediment, tissue) collected for the purposes of identification or assessment of contamination often requiring the sample to be collected, preserved, transported, and analyzed by a laboratory. "|"Sample-Routine"|"01-JAN-2014 00:00:00"|""|""|""|"30"
"7"|"Sample-Composite"|"A representative portion of a sample matrix that contains aliquots collected over time and space, combined into a single sample container, and analyzed by a lab as a single sample.  Types of composites include flow proportional, time, vertical profile, and areal composites."|"Sample-Composite Flow Proportional"|"01-JAN-2014 00:00:00"|""|""|""|"30"
"8"|"Lab Replicate"|"A replicate aliquot of a single sample that is processed and analyzed under the same conditions as the initial aliquot.  The analytical results from replicates are used to determine the precision of a system.   A replicate may be a duplicate, triplicate, or other multiple."|"Quality Control Sample-Lab Duplicate"|"01-JAN-2014 00:00:00"|""|""|""|"50"
"9"|"Laboratory Control Sample"|"A sample matrix, known to be free of analytes of interest, spiked with known and verified concentrations of an analyte, and taken through all sample preparation and analytical steps of the procedure, treated identically to the associated samples.  Could also be known as a laboratory fortified blank or spiked blank. "|"Quality Control Sample-Reference Sample"|"01-JAN-2014 00:00:00"|""|""|""|"50"
"10"|"Laboratory Control Sample Replicate"|"A replicate Laboratory Control Sample prepared and analyzed within the same batch for the same target analyte(s) as the initial Laboratory Control Sample.  A replicate may be a duplicate, triplicate, or other multiple."|"Quality Control Sample-Reference Sample"|"01-JAN-2014 00:00:00"|""|""|""|"50"
"11"|"Surrogate"|"A sample fortified with a compound having similar chemical characteristics to the analytes of interest, but which is not normally found in environmental samples. Known concentrations of these compounds are added to all samples in the set before sample preparation and subsequent analysis."|"Quality Control Sample-Reference Sample"|"01-JAN-2014 00:00:00"|""|""|""|"50"
"12"|"Matrix Spike"|"A sample fortified with a known and validated concentration of analyte(s) before sample preparation and subsequent analysis."|"Sample-Positive Control"|"01-JAN-2014 00:00:00"|""|""|""|"50"

"14"|"Method Blank"|"An aliquot of an appropriate analyte-free matrix that is processed is processed simultaneously with and under the same conditions as the associated sample through all steps of the analytical procedure.  The method blank is analyzed and associated with a specific sample batch. "|"Quality Control-Negative Control"|"01-JAN-2014 00:00:00"|""|""|""|"50"
