"1"|"Direct Grab"|"An individual sample collected at one time period, generally not exceeding 15 minutes.  Grab samples represent the conditions that exist at the moment the sample is collected.  Use sample container to directly collect the sample.  For Aqueous matrices, all sample containers for individual analytes or analyte groups must be filled from the sampling location or source within the 15-minute window."|"Direct Grab"|"Direct Grab"|"01-JAN-2014 00:00:00"|""|""|""
"2"|"Intermediate Grab"|"An individual sample collected at one time period, generally not exceeding 15 minutes.  Grab samples represent the conditions that exist at the moment the sample is collected.  An intermediate device, vessel or another sample container is used to collect the intermediate grab sample. The sample is then transferred to the sample container and sent to the lab."|"Intermediate Grab"|"Intermediate Grab"|"01-JAN-2014 00:00:00"|""|""|""

"5"|"Sample-Composite Flow Proportional"|"Flow proportional samples can be collected automatically with an automatic sampler and a compatible pacing flow measuring device, semi-automatically with a flow chart and an automatic sampler capable of collecting discrete samples, or manually. There are two methods used to collect this type of sample: (1) Collect a constant sample volume per stream flow (e.g., a 200 mL sample collected for every 5,000 gallons of stream flow) at time intervals proportional to stream flow; this method provides representative samples of all waste streams when the flow is measured accurately; or (2) Collect a sample by increasing the volume of each aliquot as the flow increases, while maintaining a constant time interval between the aliquots (e.g., hourly samples are taken with the sample volume being proportional to the flow at the time the sample is taken)."|"Sample-Composite Flow Proportional"|"Samp-Comp Flow Prop"|"01-JAN-2014 00:00:00"|""|""|""
"6"|"Sample-Composite Time"|"Time composite samples are based on a constant time interval between samples. A time composite sample can be collected manually or with an automatic sampler. This type of composite is composed of discrete sample aliquots collected in one container at constant time intervals. This method provides representative samples when the flow of the sampled system is constant."|"Sample-Composite Time"|"Samp-Comp Time"|"01-JAN-2014 00:00:00"|""|""|""
