Created a .csv file as a lookup table to convert names of variables (i.e. analytes) to the same names so we can actually use it in a dropdown. For now I am only changing the ones that we will use in the first prototype of the dashboard.

1. From WIN_data_merged_20240501 I took all the unique names listed in the column "Org Analyte Name".
2. For the Guana WQ (NUTS?) data I took the unique names in the column ComponentLong in Guana_masterdata.xlsx
3. These were put in the column "original" in the lookup table: 108 variables. Note that some variable names appear duplicated, but that is because some have trailing blanks/white spaces after the names (which R will pick up as a "different" name).
4. These were sorted alphabetically.
5. The following consistent variables names were used and put in the column "new", on the row with the associated original variable name: 

Air temperature
Ammonium (filtered)
Chlorophyll
Chlorophyll a (corrected)
Chlorophyll a (uncorrected)
Fecal coliform
Dissolved oxygen
Organic carbon
pH
Salinity
Specific conductance
Total nitrogen (TKN + nitrate + nitrite)
Phosphorus (total)
Total dissolved solids
Turbidity
Water temperature

NOTE: The nitrogen variables need to be updated/checked, as right now I do not have the detailed data dictionary for the WIN data.

6. For the remaining variables the original name was copy-pasted in the "new" column.
