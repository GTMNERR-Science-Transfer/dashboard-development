This repository holds data and scripts involved in creating a data dashboard (Shiny app) for the GTMNERR.

In its current setup (Jan 2024, to be updated into different development and deployment environments), the folders hold the following information:
1. `01_Data_raw`: Raw data as received from the GTMNERR and/or other sources
2. `02_Cleaning_scripts`: R scripts to clean/tidy data for use in the dashboard
3. `03_Data_for_app`: Cleaned data in such a format that it can be used in the dashboard, usually `.Rdata` or `.Rds`.
4. `04_Tests`: Smaller scripts or apps to test visualizations or app functionalities
5. `05_DASHBOARD`: Current, latest version of the dashboard
